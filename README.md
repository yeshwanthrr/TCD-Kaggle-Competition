Income-Prediction-ML-Group Project -Repo -Team 26
This Project demonstrates solving Income Predictions for datasets available in 
"https://www.kaggle.com/c/tcd-ml-comp-201920-income-pred-group/data". Various methodologies are followed in this project
to clean the data, process the data and fit the data to the best available model to get the error rate of 9.72k. 
The problem statement for this project is available at "https://www.kaggle.com/c/tcd-ml-comp-201920-income-pred-group/overview".

Required Dependencies:

IDE to run the python code(Ex. Spyder)
Install below mentioned dependent packages using PIP installer.
lightgbm, pandas, sklearn 
Execute GroupSubmission-100.py in Python Console.

This code fit the data to RandomForestRegressor model. If required clean the data again and change the parameters of the lightgbm model and check the accuracy.

Check the accuracy of model by verifying the mae in the output.
